High school so far has been a roller coaster, full of ups and downs. While there have been moments I’ve loved, there are times I’ve really struggled with it too. Each day brings something new to learn, often by giving up on sleep—haha! Regardless of the challenges, it’s been an eventful journey, especially because I’ve had the chance to make new friends along the way. 
My freshman year of high school was mostly about settling in, so there isn’t much to say. However, now that I’m in my sophomore year, I’m starting to open up, explore my interests, and figure out what I enjoy. I’m still undecided about what I want to pursue in the future, and I often feel confused about my path. But I’m excited to discover more about myself as I go.
I've applied to start an archery club, and I'm really looking forward to making it a reality. I hope the school approves my proposal and supports the club’s development.
  In my shop class, I learned the basics of coding we also developed a website for our hypothetical client.
